AE-AdHoc

AE::AdHoc is a simplified AnyEvent interface intended for tests, examples,
and hastily written scripts.

It boils down to:

  use AE::AdHoc;

  my $result = ae_recv {
		do_something ( # the code under test
			on_success => ae_send,  # callback - all done, stop event loop
			on_failure => ae_croak, # callback - something happened, abort event loop
		);
	} 10; # timeout - fail test if it takes too long

	# later
	is ($result, $excepted_result, "...");

This module is under development for now.
